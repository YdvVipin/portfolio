      Meet QA Automation AI Enabler — my flagship project.
      Over fifty thousand lines of code, seventy-two FastAPI endpoints,
      and eighteen specialized AI agents working together
      to automate the entire QA lifecycle.

      # Architecture: 3-Layer Pipeline

      Layer 1: Browser Recorder (Chrome Extension)
        → Captures user interactions in real-time

      Layer 2: Deterministic Parser (FastAPI)
        → Converts raw events to structured actions

      Layer 3: AI Code Generator (Multi-LLM)
        → Generates production-ready Playwright tests
    filename: "architecture.md"
    narration: >
      The architecture follows a three-layer pipeline.
      First, a Chrome extension records browser interactions.
      Then, a deterministic parser structures raw events into actions.
      Finally, a multi-LLM AI layer generates production-ready
      Playwright test scripts with self-healing locators.

              model="gpt-4",
              strategy="deterministic_first"
          )
          result = await agent.run(spec)

    filename: "api/endpoints.py"
    narration: >
      Here's a glimpse at the API layer. Each endpoint triggers
      a specialized AI agent. The test generator uses a
      deterministic-first strategy — AI only kicks in when
      rule-based generation isn't confident enough.
      The self-healing agent automatically fixes broken locators
      when the UI changes.

      The heart of the system is the Agent Orchestrator.
      Eighteen specialized agents — from test generation
      to self-healing locators to intelligent report analysis.
      Each agent has a focused responsibility, and the orchestrator
      coordinates them through a planning pipeline with shared memory.

      The React dashboard brings it all together.
      Record browser sessions, view generated test scripts,
      monitor agent status in real-time, and track test coverage.
      Everything is designed for QA engineers who want
      AI-powered automation without the complexity.
