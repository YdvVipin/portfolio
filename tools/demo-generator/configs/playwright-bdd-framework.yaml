      # Playwright BDD Framework
      # TypeScript + Cucumber BDD
      # 3 AI Agents for Smart Testing
      # 9-Tier Intelligent Locator System
    filename: "project-overview.ts"
    narration: >
      The Playwright BDD Framework combines TypeScript,
      Cucumber BDD, and three AI agents
      with a nine-tier intelligent locator system.
      It's designed for enterprise-grade test automation.

      // 9-Tier Locator Strategy

      Tier 1: data-testid (most reliable)
      Tier 2: aria-label / role
      Tier 3: CSS unique ID
      Tier 4: Text content match
      Tier 5: CSS class combination
      Tier 6: XPath relative
      Tier 7: Visual proximity
      Tier 8: AI pattern match
      Tier 9: AI fallback generation

      // Each tier has a confidence score
      // System tries Tier 1 first, falls through
    filename: "locators/strategy.ts"
    narration: >
      The nine-tier locator system is the framework's secret weapon.
      Starting from the most reliable data-testid attributes,
      falling through to ARIA labels, CSS selectors,
      text matching, and finally AI-powered pattern matching.
      Each tier has a confidence score — the system always
      picks the most reliable locator available.

      // Cucumber BDD Feature
      Feature: User Authentication

        Scenario: Successful login
          Given I am on the login page
          When I enter valid credentials
            | email    | test@example.com |
            | password | SecurePass123    |
          And I click the login button
          Then I should see the dashboard
          And the welcome message shows my name

      // Step Definition (TypeScript)
      Given('I am on the login page', async () => {
        await page.goto('/login');
        await locator.find('login-form').waitFor();
      });
    filename: "features/auth.feature"
    narration: >
      BDD scenarios written in plain English, backed by
      TypeScript step definitions. The framework integrates
      the intelligent locator system directly into step definitions.
      QA engineers write human-readable tests,
      and the AI handles the element-finding complexity.

      // AI Agent Architecture

      Agent 1: Locator Intelligence Agent
        → Analyzes DOM, selects optimal locator tier
        → Self-heals broken locators automatically

      Agent 2: Test Data Agent
        → Generates context-aware test data
        → Handles edge cases and boundary values

      Agent 3: Report Analysis Agent
        → Analyzes test failures
        → Suggests fixes and identifies flaky tests
    filename: "agents/index.ts"
    narration: >
      Three AI agents enhance the framework.
      A Locator Intelligence agent that selects and heals locators.
      A Test Data agent that generates smart test data.
      And a Report Analysis agent that identifies flaky tests
      and suggests targeted fixes.
