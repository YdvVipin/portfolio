Playwright BDD — Test Framework

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Brittle tests slow teams down and block releases.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This framework combines Playwright and Cucumber BDD with accessibility checks and Allure reporting for readable, reliable automation.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Watch a smoke run: tests execute in parallel, screenshots and traces are recorded, and failures are presented with detailed traces for fast debugging.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Result: faster CI feedback and fewer production regressions.

00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:06,000
