Multi-Agent Orchestration — Agentic QA

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Coordinating test workflows across tools is time-consuming.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This orchestration layer runs specialized agents to generate tests, triage failures, and trigger remediation workflows across CI and ticketing.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Watch an agent-triggered run: agents generate a test, execute it, collect logs, and create a Jira ticket with repro steps.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Result: faster resolution and automated context for teams.
